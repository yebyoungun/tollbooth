Through the use of tools that are easily accessible on most Kali Linux distributions, Tollbooth streamlines the process for a PenTester to do a MitM attack by arp spoofing, redirecting web traffic to a proxy server, and returning a web page request with a CA certificate that our proxy server provides, allowing for HTTPS traffic to flow back and forth to an unsuspecting victim machine. 
All the while, the attacker is able to view the web traffic and any personal information that the victim might be feeding to a webpage in an unencrypted format.
