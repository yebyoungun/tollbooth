Tollbooth was created to streamline the process for a PenTester to infiltrate a local network and steal user credentials from an unsuspecting victim.

Through the use of tool that are easily accessible on most Kali Linux distributions, the attack does arp spoofing, redirection of web traffic to a proxy server,
and returns the requested web traffic with a "Trusted" CA certificate to allow for https traffic to flow back and forth to an unsuspecting victims machine. 
All the while, the attacker is able to see the web traffic and to steal any personal informaiton (in clear text) that the victim might be feeding to a "Trusted" webpage.
